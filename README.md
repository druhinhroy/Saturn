# Saturn

Welcome to Saturn, a personal voice assistant. I have been made in Python for the Sonoma Hacks 2.0 Hackatho in 2022. If you wish to run me, I come in bundled form (only for MacOS) or you can run the Saturn.py file by cloning this repository.

# Installation

  The bundled MacOS app is located in the dist folder.
  The python script will not run on MacOS M1 (the bundled app should work if you use Rosetta 2) or Windows for ARM
